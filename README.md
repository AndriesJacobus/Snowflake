# Snowflake
Fun java app that prints a unique Snowflake in the terminal

## Usage:
Compile and run with `javac Snowflake.java; java Snowflake x` where `x` is any off number from 1 to 15.<br/>
This number represents the size of the Snowflake, as well as the likelihood that it will be unique (on a scale from 1 to 15).
<br/>
<br/>
After you run the script, your Snowflake will be configured and printed onto the terminal. After configuration, your Snowflake will be continously rotated and printed to the terminal. To exit the script, type in the termination command (might be `<ctrl><x>`, might be `<ctrl><c>`, might be some other funky command).

## Notes:
<ul>
  <li>You have to enter an odd number as your Snowflake size. If you don't, your number will be made odd.</li>
  <li>The program is best experienced in a 80 x 25 terminal. Anything <i>smaller</i> will scew the output for large Snowflakes (larger terminals are fine)</li>
</ul>
